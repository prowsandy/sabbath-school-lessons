### A MAN KNOWN ONLY AS CARLOS

J. Carlos Sanchez Ruiz is president of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Uruguay in South America. In his own country, Peru, people say “Hello, pastor-president,” to a man with Carlos’s job. But things are different in Uruguay. There, Pastor Ruiz is known only as Carlos.

It was in 2011 when Pastor Ruiz became a president of the Adventist churches in Uruguay. It took him about a year after that to get used to people calling him by his first name. “Uruguay is different from other countries in South America,” Ruiz says. “Uruguayans respect leadership. But in their eyes, a leader is the same as everyone else.”

What makes the Uruguayans this way? They are very European in their thinking. Church leaders say that this helps make the country a wonderful place for sharing the Good News about Jesus. The Seventh-day Adventist Church has only 7,358 members in Uruguay. 3.5 million people live there. So, there is only one Adventist for 470 people. Uruguay is one of the countries in South America with the smallest number of Adventists. About half of the people in Uruguay live in the capital city, Montevideo.

In 2019, Ted N. C. Wilson visited Uruguay. President Wilson is the president of the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist Church. He asked, “How will we help the people in Montevideo and other cities on this earth know who Jesus is?”

Then President Wilson opened his Bible to Jeremiah 32:26. He read, “ ‘I am the Lord. I am the God of all people. Is anything too hard for me?’ ” (Jeremiah 32:27, NIrV). President Wilson said, “God answers His own question in a powerful way.” Then he turned to Jeremiah 33:3 to read the answer: “ ‘ “Judah, pray to me, and I will answer you. I will tell you important secrets. You have never heard these things before” ’ ” (Jeremiah 33:3, ERV).

“Ask God to answer this promise for Uruguay and for your work in the cities,” President Wilson said. “You face many difficult things. People who do not know Jesus care more about earning money and buying stuff than they do about learning Bible truth. But nothing is too hard for the Lord.”

God is working miracles to touch people’s hearts in Uruguay. People are getting baptized after going to meetings run by the church. One new member is Fernando Aguirre. He gave his heart to Jesus in 2019 after taking a class about how to manage stress. Please pray for Uruguay and for other promising places for witnessing in cities all over the earth.
