### STOPPED AT THE AIRPORT

We are now living in the time when God judges His people. During His work as our Judge, I think God will ask us a very important question: “Why are you saved?” I was asked this same question when my plane landed at the Portland International Airport in Oregon in the United States of America. I handed my Norwegian passport to the U.S. officer in charge. He checked my passport and then looked at me. “What are your plans?” he asked.

“I am visiting a friend,” I answered.

“What is your friend’s address?” he asked.

“I don’t know,” I said. “But she is going to meet me here at the airport.”

The officer did not look happy when I said that I did not know her address.

“So, where did you meet her?” he asked suspiciously.

“At a college near London.”

“What did you study there?” he wanted to know.

“I studied about God and Bible truth,” I answered.

The officer looked long and hard at me. Then he asked, “Are you a believer in Jesus?”

“Yes,” I said.

He looked down at my passport and then back at me.

“So, why are you saved?” he asked.

“Because Jesus died for me,” I told him.

The officer looked at me. Then he said, “Good answer. You may enter.”

I smiled and entered the United States. Then I went to the luggage area to pick up my suitcase. As I walked there, I thought about my conversation with the passport officer. Will God ask us the same question in His work as our Judge that the officer asked me: “Why are you saved?” 1 John 5:11–13 tells us why we are: “This is the word He spoke: God gave us life that lasts forever, and this life is in His Son. He that has the Son has life. He that does not have the Son of God does not have life. I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God. Now you can know you have life that lasts forever” (NLV).

Why are you saved? You can feel sure that God saves you because you can say, “Jesus died for me.”

God will answer, “Good answer. You may enter.”
