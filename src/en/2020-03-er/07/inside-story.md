### A NEW HEART FOR ALEX

Alex was born with a hole in his heart. Alex is from Finland. The doctors hoped that Alex’s heart would heal. But it didn’t. So when Alex was eight, doctors operated on Alex’s heart. After the operation, Alex’s mother looked with wonder at her small boy. She thought, For some reason God let this happen. God has a special plan for our lives.

Alex’s mom wrote about the experience on Facebook. Many people in Finland read about Alex’s experiences on his mom’s Facebook page. This gave Alex’s mom the chance to talk about God with people who normally do not have any interest in talking about God at all. God used little Alex as a worker for Him!

Alex healed fast from the operation. He went home after only five days. It was a miracle! The devil tried to snatch this little boy’s life away. But Jesus gave Alex a new heart.

That summer it was very hot. Alex complained about a pain in his chest. At the hospital, doctors saw that Alex’s heart had swelled to double its normal size (see photo below). The doctors rushed Alex to the operating room. Hours later, the doctors announced that the operation was a success. The devil had tried to snatch this little boy’s life away again. But Jesus had given him a new heart.

Alex acted strange after he got home. Usually, he was a very nice and quiet boy. But he started to fight and shout. He was very nasty to his father. One night, Alex was worse than usual. He was angry and yelled mean words. He threw his eyeglasses on the floor.

“Why are you behaving this way?” Father asked. Father put his hand on Alex’s head to pray. This was something that Father had done many times in the past before they prayed.

But this time, Alex refused the prayer. “Take your hand away!” he yelled.

Father went into the kitchen, where Mother was fixing dinner. “This behavior is not normal,” he said. “This is not our Alex. We need to pray.”

Father and Mother walked over to Alex. Without saying a word, Father put his hand on Alex’s head. Mother put her hand on Alex’s face above his eyes. “In the name of Jesus, we command you, evil spirit, to leave Alex,” Father said. “We give Alex to God, and you are not welcome in our son’s life.”

After the prayer, Alex became his normal self. He smiled and laughed as if nothing bad had ever happened!

The devil had tried to snatch this little boy’s life away again. But Jesus gave him a new heart. Mother hopes that Alex will serve Jesus when he grows up and that his story will continue to change hearts.
