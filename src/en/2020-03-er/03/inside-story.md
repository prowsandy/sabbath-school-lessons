### A FILIPINO FAMILY’S LIFE-CHANGING STORY

A Christian bookseller walked the hot streets of Butuan City, Philippines. He worked hard all day. But he sold no books. This job was his only income. So, he felt disappointed. He decided to knock on one more door. First, he prayed.

A small woman with smart eyes greeted the tired man. She smiled at him. He told her about the books he had for sale. The woman felt the Holy Spirit had led this man to her.

The woman was a Christian. For many years, she had not shown a deep interest in Jesus. Then her family became poor. At that time, the woman wanted to learn more about Jesus. But she had no money. She already had 10 children. Soon she would have three more. How could she afford this man’s book? But she knew she must buy, read, and share this special book. It was named The Great Controversy, by Ellen G. White. The book was too expensive. But she bought it anyway.

The woman’s name was Epefania Ty. More than 50 years later, the book Epefania bought that day continues to change her family’s life. She led every one of her children to Jesus. She believed what Ellen White wrote in Testimonies for the Church, volume 6, page 429: “Our work for Jesus must start in our homes. . . . It is the most important place where we can witness for Jesus.”—Adapted.

One of Epefania Ty’s sons is named Florente. He became a pastor. He is the president of the Seventh-day Adventist Church’s Philippine Printing Press in the city of Manila. Some of Epefania’s other children became leaders and teachers in Adventist churches and schools. Almost all of Epefania’s children graduated from Mountain View College. Each child who graduated helped the next child go to school there.

My name is Steven Dragoo. I knew this woman, Epefania, as “Mom.” I married one of Epefania’s daughters, Dorcas. Dorcas has taught in Adventist schools her whole life.

Mom had a stroke before I met her. She could not talk, see, or get out of bed. She tried with all her heart to talk to me when we first met. She could not. But she did not need words to move my heart. I am moved each time I think about how she answered the Holy Spirit many years earlier. Mom died in August 2013 at the age of 89.

Dozens of people have accepted Jesus because of a lonely Bible bookseller, a powerful book, and a woman whose heart was open to the Holy Spirit. I look forward to seeing Mom again at the Second Coming.
