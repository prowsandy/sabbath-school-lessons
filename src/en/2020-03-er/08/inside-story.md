### A SURPRISE IN SUDAN

For Seventh-day Adventist couples living in Sudan, life often can be difficult. That was true for me and my wife, Suzanne. We worked for ADRA, the Adventist Development and Relief Agency, in Sudan. ADRA is a special office of the Seventh-day Adventist Church that helps people in need in other countries. Some days the temperature outside in Sudan was between 102 and 108 degrees (39–42 degrees Celsius) from May to September. For sure, a cold drink was something special on days this hot.

Coming home one day, I followed my wife Suzanne into the kitchen. I sat on the counter and talked with her as she made our meal. Suzanne asked me what I wanted to drink.

“What do you have?” I asked.

She listed the names of some cold drinks we had in the refrigerator. But I didn’t want any of them.

I told her that what I really wanted more than anything was a big, cold bottle of my favorite drink. I had not had this drink since we left our home in the United States.

“We don’t have any,” Suzanne said.

Two hours later, a friend pulled into our driveway. Our friend worked with USAID, the United States Agency for International Development, in Sudan’s capital in Khartoum. USAID is a special office of the United States government. USAID helps people in need worldwide.

Our friend worked with us on several ADRA plans that USAID helped to support with money. Our friend allowed us to get mail at her home address. When the mail arrived, she brought it to us. On this day, she brought us a box filled with things that we needed badly from the United States. One of those things was shampoo. I opened the box. I knew that our American friends also had put a bag of raisins in the box for our friend too. The bag of raisins lay right on top. Under the raisins I saw two bottles of hair shampoo. But wait! Something else was in the box. I dug under the paper and found a big bottle of my favorite drink!

I never asked anyone from the United States to send me my favorite drink. But on a hot day in Sudan, I felt that God sent me a special gift. Weeks before, when I had asked my wife Suzanne for my favorite drink, the bottle was already on its way to Khartoum. God cares about even the smallest parts of our lives. He loves to give good gifts to His children too. “When we give, we show what living is all about.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, page 623, adapted. God promises, “But those people who go to the Lord for help will have every good thing” (Psalm 34:10, ICB). God saw my wish for my favorite drink earlier that day in the kitchen. He must have smiled and thought, “Wait and see what I have for you!”
