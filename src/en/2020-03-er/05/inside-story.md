### FOUR DREAMS

Abraham Keita had the first dream after he prayed on his prayer mat in Bufa at 3:00 a.m. Bufa is a village in Guinea in West Africa.

Abraham prayed, “I am more than 40 years old. I do not have a wife, children, work, or money. Please help me. I want You to turn me into a special messenger. Then I can give other people special messages from You.”

As Abraham prayed, a wind started to blow. He fell asleep on the mat. Then someone touched him and said, “My son, go inside and sleep in your bed.”

Soon he was asleep on his bed and had his first dream. In the dream, someone with eyes the same as fire came to him. Abraham was afraid that this person would hurt him. He asked, “Who are you?”

“I am Jesus Christ,” the Man announced.

In the morning, Abraham wondered what would happen next.

The next night Abraham had another dream. He saw the Man Jesus again. He walked with Him on a mountain trail.

On the third night, Abraham dreamed that he was looking for work. He saw Jesus sitting at a table. Jesus hired workers. He wrote in a book the names of people who wanted to work for Him.

On the fourth night, Abraham saw Jesus again in a dream. Jesus stood chest-deep in the Atlantic Ocean. Jesus looked at Abraham. Abraham looked back at Jesus.

Then three years pass. Abraham moved to Conakry, Guinea’s capital city. There Abraham got a job as a builder. On his way home from work, Abraham met a Global Mission worker on the road. This worker was named Tranqulle Fassinadouno. “How are you?” Tranqulle asked. “I’m a Christian. Do you want to come to my church?”

“How can I?” Abraham said. “I belong to a different religion. I don’t even understand what you are talking about!”

At home, Abraham couldn’t stop thinking about his dreams. Then he decided to go to Tranqulle’s church. The people at the church welcomed Abraham warmly. He liked what he learned there. He came back every Sabbath after that. Soon Abraham gave his heart to Jesus.

Today, Abraham Keita works for the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Guinea. Part of the money that you give for the 13th Sabbath Offering will help an Adventist school in Conakry.

“My dreams led me to Jesus,” Abraham says. “I walk with Him now, just as I did in one of my dreams. I am on a journey with Jesus.”
